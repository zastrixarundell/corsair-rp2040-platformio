# Corsair RP2040 PlatformIO Example

This is a example project of where you can use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) to setup an [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html) as a device for the [Corsair Lightning Protocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol).

Use cases: (My usage) PC motherboard does not have an RGB connector while PC case does. Using an RP2040 connected via a USB C cable can send RGB information to the case itself, allowing it to be synced with OpenRGB

## Setting up

PlatformIO should auto setup all of the dependencies by itself and it should automatically build without an intervention. If something happens please do open an issue.
